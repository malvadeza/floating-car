# Floating Car

Android application for vehicular and cellphone data acquisition. The data collected by this application is
used to feed a open database for researchers. This application was made as the final project for my Bachelor's
Degree in the [Federal University of Sergipe][1] through the [Departament of Computer Science][3].

## Status

> TL;DR
> This code is a mess and I'm well aware of that. I did this while I was learning Android and with a tight
> deadline. Doesn't change the fact that is a horrible piece of s*&t.

With that said, I'm trying to convert the project for a more manageable architecture, [Clean Architecture][2].
For the next month, ~~I'll be doing some work on the `clean` branch~~ I've merged the `clean` branch to the `master`
and will continue to do somework on it.

## ToDo

* Tests
* CI (probably circleci)
* Configure Dagger
* Translate Kotlin files to Java (I have another project in Kotlin already, will leave this one full Java)
* Realm or Room?
* Firebase
